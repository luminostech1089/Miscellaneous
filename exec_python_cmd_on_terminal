Do you want to do some quick parsing on the file content? 
You can do it quickly in terminal.
python provides -c arguments to execute commands.

e.g. 
# Q. open a file and print all lines matching a pattern
python -c 'import re
with open(filename, "r") as fh:
   print [line for line in fh if re.search(pattern, line)]'

Interesting this is that, you can scroll up/down like the any command and update if required.
