If you came across a prblem where you want to fetch what is the thread name or process id/name at runtime, you can achieve this as follows:

import multiprocessing
import threading 

# Print process/thread name
print multiprocessing.current_process().name  
print threading.current_thread().name

# Print process id
print multiprocessing.current_process().pid
